- Fetch Data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts from Home Screen and save data in Redux Store.
- Feed this downloaded data to FlatList inside of the Home Screen.
- Tap on any FlatList Item and Redirect the app to Details Screen and pass along the tapped item Object.
- On Details Screen, there will be two TextInputs for body and title, which will be prepopulated with the data from passed object.
- Create an action to update an item inside of the data array which has been stored inside of the redux store.
